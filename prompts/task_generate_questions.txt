# INSTRUCTIONS FOR ASKING CLARIFYING QUESTIONS
## Optimized for Weaker Models Generating Prompts for Stronger Models

CURRENT TASK: Execute STEP 2 - Classify complexity tier, then ask appropriate questions

User's draft prompt: {draft_prompt}

====================
STEP 1: CLASSIFY TASK COMPLEXITY TIER
====================

**Classify the prompt request into one of 3 tiers using these EXPLICIT RULES:**

### TIER 1: SIMPLE TASK

**Use TIER 1 if the request matches 2+ of these:**
- [ ] Request is 1-2 sentences
- [ ] No specific deliverable format mentioned (no "write a blog post", "create a report")
- [ ] User asks for explanation or understanding ("explain X", "help me understand Y")
- [ ] No detailed requirements listed
- [ ] No specific constraints mentioned (length, tone, format)
- [ ] General educational or informational purpose

**Examples:**
- "Help me create a prompt to explain quantum physics"
- "I need a prompt to understand machine learning basics"
- "Prompt for learning about the French Revolution"

**Question approach:** Ask 2-3 questions maximum

---

### TIER 2: MEDIUM TASK

**Use TIER 2 if the request matches 2+ of these:**
- [ ] User specifies a deliverable type (blog post, email, analysis, code, presentation)
- [ ] Some context is provided (audience, purpose, or basic constraints)
- [ ] Request is 2-4 sentences
- [ ] User lists 2-4 specific requirements
- [ ] Mentions specific use case or application
- [ ] Has a clear output format in mind

**Examples:**
- "Create a prompt for writing marketing copy for our SaaS product"
- "I need a prompt to explain selection bias vs OVB for my exam"
- "Help me prompt an AI to generate Python code for data analysis"
- "Prompt for writing a LinkedIn post about leadership"

**Question approach:** Ask 3-4 questions using structured categories

---

### TIER 3: COMPLEX TASK

**Use TIER 3 if the request matches 2+ of these:**
- [ ] User lists 5+ specific requirements or components
- [ ] Request mentions multiple sections/phases/steps
- [ ] High-stakes context (comprehensive research, professional deliverable, important project)
- [ ] User explicitly says: "detailed", "comprehensive", "complete", "thorough"
- [ ] Multiple different deliverable types involved
- [ ] Complex integration or multi-stage process
- [ ] Request is 5+ sentences with detailed specifications

**Examples:**
- "Create a prompt for a comprehensive research paper covering X, Y, Z with literature review, methodology, analysis, and conclusions"
- "I need a prompt to build a complete content marketing strategy including social media, email campaigns, and blog posts"
- "Help me create a prompt for an AI to develop full technical documentation with API reference, tutorials, and examples"

**Question approach:** Ask 4-5 questions using full framework

---

**CLASSIFICATION FLOWCHART:**
```
1. Count sentences in request → 1-2? Likely TIER 1
2. Check for deliverable type mentioned → No? Likely TIER 1
3. Check for "comprehensive/detailed/complete" → Yes? Likely TIER 3
4. Count specific requirements → 0-1? TIER 1 | 2-4? TIER 2 | 5+? TIER 3
5. When uncertain → Default to TIER 2
```

====================
TIER 1: SIMPLE TASK QUESTIONS (2-3 questions)
====================

**Prompting Technique: Zero-Shot Foundation**
Simple tasks typically use zero-shot prompting, which requires minimal context. Focus only on what's essential.

### Question Framework

Ask only the MOST CRITICAL information:

**Question 1 - Context/Background (ALWAYS ask)**
```
What's [the user's background / the context] for this?
- [Option A related to user level/role]
- [Option B related to user level/role]
- [Option C related to user level/role]
```

**Question 2 - Goal/Use Case (ALWAYS ask)**
```
What will this be used for?
- [Option A: learning/understanding]
- [Option B: teaching/explaining to others]
- [Option C: work/professional task]
- [Option D: other specific use]
```

**Question 3 - Format Preference (OPTIONAL - only if relevant)**
```
How should this be formatted/structured?
- [Option A]
- [Option B]
- [Option C]
```

### Response Format

```
To create the best prompt, I just need to know:

1. [Question 1 with 3-4 specific options]
2. [Question 2 with 3-4 specific options]
[3. Question 3 if needed - only if format really matters]
```

### Example (TIER 1)

**User:** "Help me create a prompt to explain blockchain"

**Your questions:**
```
To create the best prompt, I just need to know:

1. What's your background with blockchain - complete beginner, some familiarity, or looking to deepen existing knowledge?
2. What will you use this for - personal learning, explaining to others, or professional work?
```

**Why only 2 questions:**
- Simple explanatory task (zero-shot)
- Background determines language complexity
- Use case determines depth and focus
- Format not critical for explanation

====================
TIER 2: MEDIUM TASK QUESTIONS (3-4 questions)
====================

**Prompting Techniques: Role-Based + Contextual + Few-Shot (optional)**
Medium tasks benefit from detailed roles and context. May need examples for specific formatting.

### The 4-Category Framework (Pick 3-4 most relevant)

Use these categories but be SELECTIVE - not all categories matter equally for every task.

**Category 1: Background & Context**
```
What's your [background/experience level/context]?
- [3-4 specific options relevant to domain]
```

**Category 2: Goal & Use Case**
```
What's the goal/purpose?
- [3-4 specific options]
```

**Category 3: Format & Approach**
```
How should this be [formatted/structured/approached]?
- [3-4 specific options]
```

**Category 4: Constraints & Specifics**
```
Are there specific [requirements/constraints/things to include or avoid]?
- [3-4 specific options or open-ended]
```

### Selection Logic

**For TIER 2, ask questions from:**
- Category 1 (Background) - ALMOST ALWAYS
- Category 2 (Goal) - ALMOST ALWAYS
- Category 3 OR 4 (pick which matters more for this task)
- Sometimes both 3 AND 4 if both are critical

### Response Format

```
To create the best prompt for you, I need to understand:

1. [Category 1 question with options]
2. [Category 2 question with options]
3. [Category 3 or 4 question with options]
[4. Optional 4th question if both Category 3 and 4 matter]
```

### Example (TIER 2)

**User:** "Create a prompt for writing LinkedIn posts about leadership"

**Your questions:**
```
To create the best prompt for you, I need to understand:

1. What's your role/position - early-career professional building presence, mid-level manager sharing experiences, or senior executive thought leader?
2. What's the goal for these posts - building personal brand, sharing lessons learned, starting discussions, or establishing expertise?
3. What style works best - professional and polished, conversational and authentic, or inspirational and motivational?
4. Any specific topics or themes to focus on - team management, decision-making, career growth, or leadership philosophy?
```

**Why 4 questions:**
- Role determines voice and credibility (Category 1)
- Goal affects content strategy (Category 2)
- Style is critical for LinkedIn (Category 3)
- Topics help focus the prompt (Category 4)

====================
TIER 3: COMPLEX TASK QUESTIONS (4-5 questions)
====================

**Prompting Techniques: Role-Based + Contextual + Few-Shot + Structured Output + Chain of Thought (if applicable)**
Complex tasks require comprehensive information across all dimensions. Often need multiple prompting techniques combined.

### Use All 4 Categories + Domain-Specific

For TIER 3, systematically cover all categories plus add domain-specific questions as needed.

**The Full Framework:**

1. **Background & Context** (ALWAYS)
2. **Goal & Use Case** (ALWAYS)
3. **Format & Approach** (ALWAYS)
4. **Constraints & Specifics** (ALWAYS)
5. **Domain-Specific Question** (If applicable - technical requirements, specific methodologies, etc.)

### Response Format

```
To create the best prompt for you, I need to clarify several things:

1. [Background question with specific options]
2. [Goal question with specific options]
3. [Format question with specific options]
4. [Constraints question with specific options or open-ended]
[5. Domain-specific question if applicable]
```

### Example (TIER 3)

**User:** "I need a comprehensive prompt for an AI to create a full content marketing strategy including blog posts, social media, email campaigns, and SEO optimization"

**Your questions:**
```
To create the best prompt for you, I need to clarify several things:

1. What's your company/product context - B2B SaaS, B2C e-commerce, professional services, or other industry?
2. Who's your target audience - their role, expertise level, pain points, and where they spend time online?
3. What's the primary goal - brand awareness, lead generation, customer education, or direct sales conversions?
4. What level of detail do you need - high-level strategy outline, detailed tactical plan with examples, or complete execution-ready content?
5. Are there any existing brand guidelines, content restrictions, or specific platforms/channels you must include or avoid?
```

**Why 5 questions:**
- Context critical for strategy (Category 1)
- Audience defines everything (Category 1 extended)
- Goal determines metrics and approach (Category 2)
- Detail level affects prompt structure (Category 3)
- Constraints ensure feasibility (Category 4)

====================
QUESTION CONSTRUCTION RULES (ALL TIERS)
====================

### Rule 1: Always Provide Specific Options

**Bad (too generic):**
- "What's your goal?"
- "Who is this for?"

**Good (specific options):**
- "What's your goal - exam preparation, work project, or personal learning?"
- "Who is this for - beginners, intermediate learners, or experts?"

### Rule 2: Show Domain Understanding

Tailor options to the actual domain:

**Academic request:**
"What's this for - exam prep, homework, research paper, or self-study?"

**Business request:**
"What's the goal - lead generation, brand awareness, or customer education?"

**Technical request:**
"What's your experience level - beginner learning basics, intermediate building projects, or advanced optimizing code?"

### Rule 3: Reference What User Already Said

**Good:**
- "You mentioned leadership posts - what's your current role: early-career, mid-level manager, or senior executive?"

**Bad:**
- "What's your role?" (when they already said something relevant)

### Rule 4: Keep Questions Scannable

Format for easy reading:
```
1. [Clear question]
   - Option A
   - Option B
   - Option C
   - Option D
```

QUALITY CHECKLIST BEFORE ASKING
====================

Before finalizing your questions, verify:

**For ALL tiers:**
- Have I provided 3-4 specific options for each question?
- Are my questions tailored to the actual domain?
- Am I building on what the user already said?
- Would different answers significantly change the prompt?

**For TIER 1 specifically:**
- Am I asking ONLY 2-3 questions?
- Are these the absolute minimum needed?
- Am I avoiding over-engineering a simple request?

**For TIER 2 specifically:**
- Have I covered 3 of the 4 core categories?
- Did I skip the less relevant category?
- Are my questions focused on what matters for this deliverable?

**For TIER 3 specifically:**
- Have I covered all 4 core categories?
- Is there a domain-specific question if needed?
- Am I gathering enough info for a complex prompt?

====================
COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID
====================

### Mistake 1: Wrong Tier Classification
- Using TIER 3 for "explain X" (overkill)
- Using TIER 1 for "comprehensive research paper" (insufficient)
- Follow the explicit rules for classification

### Mistake 2: Asking Too Many Questions for Simple Tasks
- 5 questions for "explain quantum physics"
- 2-3 questions max for TIER 1

### Mistake 3: Asking Too Few Questions for Complex Tasks
- 2 questions for "full content marketing strategy"
- 4-5 questions for TIER 3

### Mistake 4: Generic Questions
- "What do you want?"
- "What's your goal - exam prep, work project, or personal learning?"

### Mistake 5: Not Providing Options
- "What's your background?"
- "What's your background - beginner, intermediate, or advanced?"
