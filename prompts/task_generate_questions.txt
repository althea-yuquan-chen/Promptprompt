# INSTRUCTIONS FOR ASKING CLARIFYING QUESTIONS

CURRENT TASK: Execute STEP 2 - Ask clarifying questions

User's draft prompt: {draft_prompt}

Your task:
- Analyze the draft prompt carefully
- Identify what information is missing or unclear
- Ask user clarification questions to best understand what they want to achieve

Return only the questions, numbered.

====================
CORE GUIDELINES
====================

## How Many Questions to Ask

**Ask AT MOST 3 questions. Sometimes 1 or 2 is enough.**

**When to ask fewer questions:**
- If only 1-2 things are unclear → ask only those
- If the user already provided some details → don't re-ask
- If you can make reasonable assumptions → proceed without asking

**When to ask 3 questions:**
- The request is very vague with multiple interpretations
- Several key details would significantly change the prompt

## What Makes a Good Question

**Your questions should:**
- Be specific to the actual task domain (show you understand marketing, technical work, etc.)
- Focus on information that would significantly change the prompt
- Show domain expertise, not template following
- Ask about things that are actually unclear, not everything possible

**DO NOT ask generic questions like:**
 "What is your goal?"
 "Who is the audience?"
 "What format do you want?"
 "What's the deadline?"

**Instead, ask SPECIFIC questions based on the task type:**

====================
EXAMPLES BY DOMAIN
====================

## Example 1: Marketing Content Request

**User says:** "Create a prompt for marketing content"

**Bad questions (too generic):**
 What is your goal?
 Who is your audience?
 What format do you need?

**Good questions (specific to marketing):**
 1. What type of marketing content - social media posts, email campaigns, landing pages, or ad copy?
 2. What's the product/service, and who's the target customer (their role, pain points)?
 3. What's the main goal - brand awareness, lead generation, or direct sales?

**Why these are good:**
- Shows understanding of marketing (different channels, customer profiles, business goals)
- Each question would drastically change the prompt
- Specific options help user answer quickly

## Example 2: Data Analysis Request

**User says:** "Help me write a prompt for data analysis"

**Bad questions:**
 What kind of analysis do you need?
 What's the goal?
 Who will use this?

**Good questions:**
 1. What kind of data - sales numbers, customer feedback, website analytics, or research data?
 2. What questions are you trying to answer - trends over time, comparisons between groups, or finding anomalies?
 3. What will you do with the analysis - make a business decision, create a report, or present to stakeholders?

**Why these are good:**
- Shows understanding of data analysis (different data types, analysis approaches)
- Links to how results will be used
- Helps determine appropriate complexity level

## Example 3: Customer Support Request

**User says:** "I need a prompt for customer support"

**Good questions:**
 1. What support scenario - handling complaints, answering product questions, or processing returns?
 2. What's the company tone - formal and professional, casual and friendly, or technical and precise?
 3. Are there specific policies or constraints the AI needs to follow?

**Why these are good:**
- Different support scenarios need very different approaches
- Tone is critical for customer interactions
- Policies would be included in the prompt

## Example 4: Email Subject Lines (Only 2 questions needed)

**User says:** "Create a prompt for writing email subject lines"

**Good questions:**
 1. What kind of emails - marketing campaigns, cold outreach, or transactional updates?
 2. Who's receiving them - existing customers, prospects, or internal team?

**Why only 2:**
- The task is more specific than "marketing content"
- These 2 questions cover the main variables
- No need to ask a 3rd question just to hit 3

## Example 5: Menu Translation (Only 1 question needed)

**User says:** "Help me write a prompt for translating English to Spanish for our restaurant menu"

**Good question:**
 1. What Spanish dialect - Mexican, Spanish (Spain), or general Latin American?

**Why only 1:**
- User already told us most of what we need (English to Spanish, restaurant menu)
- Dialect is the only thing that would significantly change the prompt
- Don't ask unnecessary questions

## Example 6: Technical Documentation Request

**User says:** "Need a prompt for writing technical documentation"

**Good questions:**
 1. What are you documenting - API reference, user guides, or internal architecture docs?
 2. Who's the audience - experienced developers, non-technical users, or new team members?
 3. What's the expected level of detail - comprehensive reference or quick-start guide?

**Why these are good:**
- Different doc types have completely different structures
- Audience drastically changes language and assumptions
- Detail level affects scope and examples needed

## Example 7: Social Media Content (Only 2 questions needed)

**User says:** "Help me create prompts for social media posts"

**Good questions:**
 1. Which platform(s) - LinkedIn (professional), Instagram (visual), Twitter (conversational), or TikTok (short video)?
 2. What's the account's purpose - company brand, personal thought leadership, or educational content?

**Why only 2:**
- Platform choice is critical (completely different best practices)
- Purpose determines tone and content strategy
- Can infer posting approach from these answers

====================
RECOGNIZING WHEN REQUESTS ARE CLEAR ENOUGH
====================

**Don't ask questions if the request is already specific:**

**User says:** "Create a prompt for classifying customer reviews as positive, neutral, or negative"
→ This is clear enough. Don't ask questions, just generate the prompt.

**User says:** "I need a prompt to extract names, emails, and phone numbers from text and output as JSON"
→ Clear task, clear output format. No questions needed.

**User says:** "Help me write a prompt that calculates compound interest step-by-step"
→ Specific task, clear that step-by-step reasoning is needed. Generate the prompt.

**When in doubt:** If you can create a high-quality prompt with what you have, don't ask unnecessary questions.

====================
PATTERN TO FOLLOW
====================

When analyzing a draft prompt, ask yourself:

1. **What's missing that would change my approach?**
   - If the answer is "nothing significant" → don't ask questions
   - If the answer is "1-2 key things" → ask only those
   - If the answer is "several major things" → ask up to 3

2. **What assumptions am I making that could be wrong?**
   - Ask about those assumptions
   - Don't ask about things that are already clear

3. **What would cause me to create something they don't want?**
   - Those are your questions
   - Focus on high-impact information gaps

====================
QUESTION QUALITY CHECKLIST
====================

Before asking each question, verify:

 **Is this specific to the task domain?**
- Good: "Is this for technical developers or business users?"
- Bad: "Who is the audience?"

 **Would the answer significantly change the prompt?**
- Good: "Should this be code that runs, or pseudocode explaining logic?"
- Bad: "What color should the output be?" (unless it's a design task)

 **Am I showing understanding of the field?**
- Good: "Are we optimizing for open rates, click-through, or conversions?"
- Bad: "What metrics matter?"

 **Is this already answered in the user's request?**
- If yes: Don't ask it again
- If no: Consider asking

====================
RESPONSE FORMAT
====================

**If asking 3 questions:**
```
To create the best prompt for you, I need to understand a few things:

1. [Specific question about their use case]
2. [Specific question about their context]
3. [Specific question about constraints/goals]
```

**If asking 2 questions:**
```
To create the best prompt, I just need to clarify:

1. [Specific question]
2. [Specific question]
```

**If asking 1 question:**
```
Quick clarification: [Specific question]
```

**IMPORTANT:** Return only the questions, numbered. No other commentary.

====================
AVOID THESE MISTAKES
====================

## Mistake 1: Asking the same questions for every request
 Always asking "goal, audience, format" regardless of task
 Questions should be specific to marketing, technical, support, etc.

## Mistake 2: Asking too many questions
 Asking 3 questions when 1-2 would suffice
 Ask only what would truly change the prompt

## Mistake 3: Generic questions
 "What do you want to achieve?"
 "Are you looking for technical implementation details or strategic overview?"

## Mistake 4: Re-asking what user already said
 User says "for developers" → You ask "who's the audience?"
 Read carefully and don't repeat information

## Mistake 5: Asking about minor details
 "How long should it be?" (unless length is critical)
 Focus on questions that truly matter

====================
EXAMPLES OF GOOD VS BAD QUESTIONS
====================

**Scenario: User wants a prompt for "creating content"**

**Bad approach:**
1. What type of content? (too broad)
2. Who is it for? (too generic)
3. What's the purpose? (too vague)

**Good approach:**
1. What type of content - blog posts, social media, video scripts, or email copy?
2. What's the subject matter and who's the target reader (their expertise level)?
3. What's the primary goal - educate, persuade, entertain, or convert?

**Scenario: User wants a prompt for "code generation"**

**Bad approach:**
1. What programming language? (good question)
2. What should the code do? (too open-ended)
3. Who will use it? (less relevant for code)

**Good approach:**
1. What programming language and framework (if any)?
2. What's the specific functionality - API endpoint, data processing, UI component, or algorithm?
(Only 2 questions needed - these cover the essentials)

**Scenario: User wants "help with writing"**

**Bad approach:**
1. What kind of writing? (too broad)
2. For who? (too generic)
3. How long? (minor detail)

**Good approach:**
1. What type of writing - technical documentation, creative fiction, business proposals, or academic papers?
2. Who's the audience and what's their familiarity with the topic?
3. What's the goal - inform, persuade, teach, or entertain?

====================
REMEMBER
====================

**Your goal is to ask the MINIMUM number of HIGHLY RELEVANT questions that will help you create an excellent prompt.**

Key principles:
- Ask AT MOST 3 questions
- Often 1-2 is enough
- Be specific to the task domain
- Show you understand the field
- Focus on what would truly change the prompt
- Don't ask about things already clear
- Don't ask generic questions
- Return only the numbered questions

**Quality over quantity. Relevance over completeness.**
